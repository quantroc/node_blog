# Advanced Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates an advanced Hardhat use case, integrating other tools commonly used alongside Hardhat in the ecosystem.

The project comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts. It also comes with a variety of other tools, preconfigured to work with the project code.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat help
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat coverage
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
TS_NODE_FILES=true npx ts-node scripts/deploy.ts
npx eslint '**/*.{js,ts}'
npx eslint '**/*.{js,ts}' --fix
npx prettier '**/*.{json,sol,md}' --check
npx prettier '**/*.{json,sol,md}' --write
npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol'
npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol' --fix
```

# Spectre verification

To try out Spectre verification, you first need to deploy a contract to an Spectre network.

In this project, enter the private key of the account which will send the deployment transaction. With a valid .env file in place, first deploy your contract:

```shell
npx hardhat run --network spectretestnet scripts/deploy/ExchangeMH.js

Then, flatten the contract file that has just been deployed following command :npx hardhat flatten contracts/Exchange1155.sol > Exchange1155Flatten.sol 

Then, copy the deployment address and find it in https://testnet.spectre-scan.io/. Verify contract and interact with this.
```

# Upgradeable contract
This contract use OpenZeppelin-Upgradeable to upgrade contract.

```shell
npx hardhat run --network spectretestnet scripts/deploy/Upgradeable_Exchange1155.js

Upgrade contract : copy proxy address and deploy contract version2 with proxy address following command:

npx hardhat run --network spectretestnet scripts/deploy/Upgradeable_Example_721.js

```
